It has been a real pleasure using the book and my ability to program has increased beyond my wildest expectations, Thank you. Excellent!'' ''I found it clear, concise, realistically priced and is helping correct my deficient knowledge immensely.'' 20th February 2003 Reviewer: Dr. Geoff Fowler, Technical Director, Oilfield Consultancy: ''I am Technical Director of a small Oilfield Chemistry consultancy and taught myself, rather badly, Access. However all the books I bought and many online resources assume a level of knowledge hence the many mistakes I make in building databases for myself. I was browsing PC World and came across your Successful ICT Projects in Access. I found it clear, concise, realistically priced and is helping correct my deficient knowledge immensely. I will try and get your VBA book as well. Excellent! I think they are wicked!'' ''A first rate text which cannot fail to improve grades'' 3rd May, 2002 Reviewer: Miss Fozia Akram a student from Wakefield College, England: ''I would like to thank you for publishing such great books, I have purchased the A2 ICT and Access books and I think they are wicked. Thank you Payne-Gallway and thank you Pat Heathcote, lets just hope my revision pays off. A first rate text which cannot fail to improve grades''. ''The ''paint by numbers'' approach is exactly what is needed as it quickly gets results.'' 22nd September, 2001 Reviewer: Kev Randle from Sheffield, England: ''This guide to producing an ''A'' level project is going to take some beating. Some of my students have made fantastic progress in just a few hours from a starting point of zero experience with access. The ''paint by numbers'' approach is exactly what is needed as it quickly gets results. Probably feeds the ''instant gratification '' that most of our students are supposed to demand. I don''t care. As a teacher it has certainly made my life a great deal less painful and I can recommend this text to anyone taking, or teaching the AQA ICT or Computing course. It''s not even hard. Life saver!''. ''I wouldn''t have been able to do the project without it.'' 4th November, 2001 Reviewer: A Student from High Wycombe, England: ''This book pretty much lays out what is needed in the project in simple terms so that it can be adapted to your own project. Not only does it give the IT side but also the written work which is in part more important than the actual system. I wouldn''t have been able to do the project without it. Excellent book as an introduction to Access''. ''It is by far and away the most practical publication I have read on the subject'' 1st October, 2001 Reviewer: Sean Scaife from Dublin, Ireland: ''As a newcomer to Access, although over 20 years in the IT industry in various capacities, I found this work to be invaluable in being able to grasp the fundamentals of Access development. It is by far and away the most practical publication I have read on the subject, In fact I would go so far as to say that it is an object lesson to most authors of introductory works in so far that is PRACTICAL in real world sense. I have already passed on my original copy to a former colleague and have this morning recommended it to another colleague who will be purchasing it. I have no problem spending ...on other manuals but this work has helped me to produce working solutions in a very short time. Congratulations, A fan, excellent''. 17th January, 2001 Reviewer: A Reader from Leicester, England: ''This book really helps with the AS IT course when you need to do your coursework. If you are planning on using Access for your coursework, I really recommend it as it comes in very useful indeed''.",

            "description": "Book Description Understanding Directory Servicesclarifies the complex topic of directory services, starting with basic theory and archetypes, and then working its way up to the current directory service implementations. It describes the basic idea behind directory services, explaining the underlying conceptual models, design characteristics, and methods of managing distributed information. The book begins with an overview of directory services and their core characteristics, highlighting critical aspects of directory information, distribution, and storage. The evolving nature of the information the directory contains, and the factors involved in organizing and managing it are discussed in detail, and then methods of information distribution and storage are examined at length. After exploring the basics of directory service, the book progresses to in-depth chapters on each of the critical technologies being used to implement directory services: * The X.500standards are explained to help you understand the foundations of directory services and provide a basis for comparison of the other directory technologies. *Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP) and its emerging role as a directory access standard is described in detail, with thorough explanations of models, naming, and operations. *The Domain Name System(DNS) is examined from a directory service perspective, noting parallels in structures and operations. This knowledge of directory services is then used to describe the design of X.500 and LDAP based directory service products, as well as NDS eDirectory and Active Directory, highlighting the architectural and operational implications of vendor's design decisions. This book: * Explores X.500-based directory products (eTrust, DirX, Nexor), and highlights implementation approaches and capabilities. * Describes the LDAP-based directory products (OpenLDAP, SecureWay, iPlanet), identifying similarities and differences between them. * ExplainsNDS eDirectorydescribing the underlying directory architecture and its foundations in X.500, and its evolution from an NOS-based directory to a general purpose directory service. * Examines howActive Directoryintegrates NT 4, LDAP, and DNS technologies into a directory service that leverages established Windows networks. * Explores the information management issues that meta-directories (Siemens DirXmetahub, iPlanet meta-directory, Microsoft Meta-directory Services, Novell DirXML) are designed to address, and characteristics of different types of meta-directory solutions (as well as Radiant Logic'sRadiant Onevirtual directory server). * Identifies the design of XML-based directory markup languages that map directory schema, objects, and operations providing directory interoperability. The final chapter is focused on helping you evaluate directory services in the context of your business and network environment. Information, business, and network control factors are identified, and key factors in directory service assessment are explained. Understanding Directory Servicesis an excellent reference for directory service technologies that includes extensive references and aglossarycontaining 385 directory service terms. By explaining key directory technologies, and the integration of those technologies, this book provides the information you need to understand the design and operations involved in all directory services. From the Back Cover Understanding Directory Servicesis the most in-depth resource available on directory services theory, architecture, and design. It provides the conceptual framework and critical technical information for IT professionals who are using directory services in their networks or e-business solutions. The 1st edition of this book covered the underlying directory service technologies (X.500, LDAP, DNS), and integrated the information from a networking perspective with a special focus on eDirectory and Active Directory. The 2nd Edition extends this coverage to the LDAP-based directories (such as iPlanet and SecureWay) and the X.500-based enterprise directory services (including eTrust, DirX, and Nexor), as well as the emerging meta-directory technologies and products which are crucial to the integration of the multiple directories in an enterprise networking environment. By explaining the origins and technologies of directory services, and clarifying the integration of key directory technologies into network and e-commerce platforms,Understanding Directory Servicesgives you the information you need to understand the underlying design and operations involved in all directory services. Reviews of the first edition Warren E. Wyrostek -- MCP Magazine ...superb, comprehensive...highly recommend it to all network professionals...a must read for anyone wrestling with deploying a directory service... Douglas Ludens -- About.com ...clearly organized and well written...a great book, I highly recommend it...essential to doing well with Windows 2000...",
